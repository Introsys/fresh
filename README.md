SmartAgrifood FRESH project

This project is subdivided into three parts:
- The server configuration for the backend services provided by the Fiware Platform, more specific the Orion Context Broker, Cosmos and Keystone GE and the Pep and cygnos connectors.
- The application control of the Gateway, that serves as a proxy between the sensors and the backend servers.
- The software that resides inside the Sensor Nodes.
